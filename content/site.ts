  narrative: `They met back in their architecture college days — just batchmates then, each living a separate life. She was the maarte one, the selective type who chose carefully the people she let in. He, on the other hand, was the friendly guy — kind, approachable, and someone everyone could easily talk to. They couldn't have been more different.

Three years after graduation, fate decided to draw their lines together. It started simply — a few replies to her social media stories, a borrowed book, small conversations that didn't mean much at first. She would respond briefly, not knowing that these short exchanges would one day lead to something life-changing.

Then one day, they met again at a construction site. This time, they talked — really talked. And something was different. She found him interesting, warm, and genuine. From then on, messages turned into conversations, and conversations turned into something deeper.

It was during Sinulog when he invited her to visit Sto. Niño Church. They shared prayers & laughter — spending the whole day simply enjoying each other's company. That day, something in her heart shifted. Days after she realized that maybe, just maybe, this was the man she had been praying for — someone who would bring her closer to God.

Months later, they made it official. From then on, they have learned, grown, and become better together in all aspects of life. Their love is not the kind you see in movies — not perfect, not always grand. But it is real, quiet, and steadfast. Two people, choosing each other every single day.

And now, as they begin a new chapter of their lives, they invite you to witness and celebrate the love that God has written for them.`,
  giftNote: `With all that we have, we are truly blessed. Your presence and prayer are all that we request.
But if you desire to give nonetheless, a monetary gift is the one we suggest.`,
