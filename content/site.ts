  narrative: `It all started right here ‚Äî where fate decided our paths should cross. \n
‚ÄúYes, beb, dito kami nagkakilala,‚Äù Erda says with a smile. \n
One day, Russell suddenly went down to Manila ‚Äî without her knowing. Then came that unforgettable call while he was in a taxi: \n
‚ÄúPaano pumunta ng Angono?‚Äù he asked. \n
And just like that, her heart (and her hair) grew a little longer that day. üòâ \n
Twelve years later ‚Äî after countless memories, laughter, and adventures ‚Äî their love has only grown deeper. Together, they‚Äôve built a beautiful life and now share it with the greatest blessing of all: their wonderful child, who completed their lovely family. üíñ \n
From that first ‚ÄúHi, babe‚Äù to this ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù their story has always been written with love ‚Äî and it‚Äôs only the beginning. üíç‚ú® \n `,
  giftNote: `With all that we have, we are truly blessed. Your presence and prayer are all that we request. \n
But if you desire to give nonetheless, a monetary gift is the one we suggest.`,
