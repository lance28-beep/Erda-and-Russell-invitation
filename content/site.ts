  narrative: `I can't remember when you weren't there
  When I didn't care for anyone but you
  I swear we've been through everything there is
  Can't imagine anything we've missed
  Can't imagine anything the two of us can't do \n
  
  Through the years
  You've never let me down
  You've turned my life around
  The sweetest days I've found
  I've found with you
  Through the years
  I've never been afraid
  I've loved the life we've made
  And I'm so glad I've stayed
  Right here with you
  Through the years  \n
  
  I can't remember what I used to do
  Who I trusted, whom I listened to before
  I swear you've taught me everything I know
  Can't imagine needing someone so
  But through the years it seems to me
  I need you more and more \n
  
  Through the years
  Through all the good and bad
  I know how much we had
  I've always been so glad
  To be with you
  Through the years
  It's better every day
  You've kissed my tears away
  As long as it's okay
  I'll stay with you
  Through the years \n
  
  Through the years
  When everything went wrong
  Together we were strong
  I know that I belong
  Right here with you
  Through the years
  I never had a doubt
  We'd always work things out
  I've learned what love's about
  By loving you
  Through the years \n
  
  Through the years
  You've never let me down
  You've turned my life around
  The sweetest days I've found
  I've found with you
  Through the years
  It's better every day
  You've kissed my tears away
  As long as it's okay
  I'll stay with you
  Through the years`,

But if you desire to give nonetheless, a monetary gift is the one we suggest.`,
